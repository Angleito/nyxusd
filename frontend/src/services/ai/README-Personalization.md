const analysis = engine.analyzeProfile(userProfile);

console.log(analysis.completeness); // 0.0-1.0 profile completeness
console.log(analysis.primaryDimensions); // Top weighted dimensions
console.log(analysis.personalizationPotential); // Overall personalization effectiveness potential
```

### 2. Context-Aware Strategy Selection

```typescript
const context: PersonalizationContext = {
  step: "occupation_explanation",
  concept: "compound_interest",
  urgency: "medium",
  complexity: 6,
};

const result = engine.selectPersonalization(profile, context);
console.log(result.strategy.name); // Selected strategy
console.log(result.analogies); // Relevant analogies
console.log(result.examples); // Appropriate examples
console.log(result.confidence); // Confidence score
```

### 3. Effectiveness Scoring

```typescript
const score = engine.scoreEffectiveness(
  "Like leveling up in a game, compound interest levels up your wealth over time.",
  profile,
);
console.log(score); // 0.0-1.0 effectiveness score
```

### 4. Profile Improvement Suggestions

```typescript
const improvements = engine.suggestProfileImprovements(profile);
console.log(improvements);
// [
//   "Tell me about your hobbies and interests so I can use familiar analogies",
//   "Share how you prefer to learn new concepts",
//   "Describe your work style for better-tailored advice"
// ]
```

### Profession-Based Analogies

```typescript
const PROFESSION_ANALOGIES = {
  chef: [
    "Like balancing flavors in a dish, portfolio diversification balances risk and return",
    "Just as mise en place prepares you for service, emergency funds prepare you for market volatility",
  ],
  software_engineer: [
    "Like code optimization, portfolio optimization maximizes efficiency and minimizes risk",
    "Just as you use version control, investment tracking helps manage changes over time",
  ],
  // ... more professions
};
```

### Hobby-Based Analogies

```typescript
const HOBBY_ANALOGIES = {
  gaming: [
    "Like leveling up characters, compound interest levels up your wealth over time",
    "Risk management in investing is like managing health points - don't go all-in on risky moves",
  ],
  gardening: [
    "Like planting seeds, investments need time to grow into substantial returns",
    "Portfolio diversification is like companion planting - different investments support each other",
  ],
  // ... more hobbies
};
```

### Lifestyle-Based Examples

```typescript
const LIFESTYLE_EXAMPLES = {
  busy: [
    "Set up automated investing to build wealth while focusing on your career",
    "Use index funds for hands-off diversification that doesn't require daily management",
  ],
  structured: [
    "Create a detailed investment plan with specific milestones and review dates",
    "Use systematic approaches like dollar-cost averaging for consistent investing",
  ],
  // ... more lifestyles
};
```

## Integration Guide

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import {
  PersonalizationEngine,
  convertToPersonalizationProfile,
} from "./personalizationEngine";

// In your AI service
const engine = new PersonalizationEngine();
const personalizationProfile = convertToPersonalizationProfile(userProfile);
const context = createPersonalizationContext(conversationStep, concept);
const result = engine.selectPersonalization(personalizationProfile, context);

// Apply personalization to your AI response
const personalizedResponse = applyPersonalization(
  baseResponse,
  result.analogies,
  result.examples,
  result.tone,
);
```

### Advanced Integration

```typescript
import { PersonalizedAIService } from "./personalizationIntegration";

const personalizedService = new PersonalizedAIService();

const response = await personalizedService.generatePersonalizedResponse(
  userMessage,
  enhancedContext,
);

// Access personalization metadata
console.log(response.personalization.strategy);
console.log(response.personalization.effectivenessScore);
```

## API Methods

The PersonalizationEngine provides straightforward methods for personalization:

### Core Methods

```typescript
import {
  analyzeUserProfile,
  selectPersonalizationStrategy,
} from "./personalizationEngine";

const analyzer = analyzeUserProfile(engine);
const selector = selectPersonalizationStrategy(engine);

// Use directly
const analysis = analyzer(profile);
const result = selector(profile, context);
```

### Method Chaining

```typescript
// Chain operations for convenience
const personalizeResponse = (profile, context, baseResponse) => {
  const personalizationProfile = convertToPersonalizationProfile(profile);
  const analysis = analyzer(personalizationProfile);
  const result = selector(analysis.primaryProfile, context);
  return applyPersonalization(baseResponse, result);
};
```

## Configuration and Extension

### Adding New Personalization Strategies

```typescript
const customStrategy: PersonalizationStrategy = {
  id: "risk-averse-conservative",
  name: "Risk-Averse Conservative",
  primaryDimension: {
    type: "financial",
    weight: 0.9,
    confidence: 0.8,
    attributes: { riskTolerance: "conservative" },
  },
  secondaryDimensions: [],
  applicableContexts: ["risk_assessment", "investment_goals"],
  effectivenessScore: 0.85,
};

// Add to strategies array
PERSONALIZATION_STRATEGIES.push(customStrategy);
```

### Adding New Analogies

```typescript
// Extend profession analogies
PROFESSION_ANALOGIES["data_scientist"] = [
  "Like feature engineering, portfolio construction requires selecting the right investment factors",
  "Just as you validate models, regular portfolio reviews ensure strategies remain effective",
];

// Extend hobby analogies
HOBBY_ANALOGIES["photography"] = [
  "Like adjusting exposure settings, investment allocation requires balancing risk and return",
  "Portfolio diversification is like having different lenses - each serves a specific purpose",
];
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Profile Analysis**: O(1) - constant time analysis
- **Strategy Selection**: O(n) where n = number of strategies (typically < 10)
- **Analogy Generation**: O(m) where m = number of user hobbies/interests
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - strategies and analogies are static data

- Comprehensive logging for debugging

```typescript
try {
  const result = engine.selectPersonalization(profile, context);
  // Use personalized result
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Personalization failed:", error);
  // Fall back to non-personalized response
}
```
