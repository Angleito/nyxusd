  {
    question: "What makes NyxUSD different from Djed?",
    answer: "NyxUSD offers 125% collateralization vs Djed's 400-800%, providing 3x more capital efficiency. We also feature user-defined interest rates, allowing you to set your own borrowing terms based on risk tolerance."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the three-phase architecture work?",
    answer: "Phase 1: Cardano mainnet for security and CDP creation. Phase 2: Vector L2 for performance enhancements. Phase 3: Nexus EVM for cross-chain yield access. Each phase builds progressively on the previous one."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the TEE Oracle and why is it important?",
    answer: "Our Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) oracle uses Intel SGX hardware to provide cryptographically secured price feeds. This makes price manipulation virtually impossible, with Charli3/Orcfax as fallback oracles."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the community launch work?",
    answer: "We're launching NYX tokens via SundaeSwap TasteTest for maximum fairness. 70% of tokens go directly to the community, with no VC allocations or special deals. This ensures true decentralization from day one."
  },
  {
    question: "When will AI features be available?",
    answer: "AI features including natural language CDP management and automated strategies are planned for Phase 4, post-launch. Our immediate focus is delivering a robust, secure CDP protocol first."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the risks of using NyxUSD CDPs?",
    answer: "Main risks include liquidation if your collateral falls below 125%, smart contract risks (mitigated by IOG formal verification), and oracle risks (minimized by TEE hardware security). Always manage your collateralization ratio carefully."
  },
  {
    question: "How much funding is being requested from Catalyst?",
    answer: "We're requesting â‚³50,000 from Catalyst Fund 14. This covers smart contract development, TEE oracle implementation, security audits, and community launch infrastructure."
  },
  {
    question: "What yields can I expect?",
    answer: "Cross-chain yields typically range from 5-100%+ APY depending on risk tier. Safe strategies offer 5-10%, medium risk 10-25%, and high risk 25-100%+. Your capital stays secure on Cardano while accessing these opportunities."
