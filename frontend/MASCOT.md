## Lore Notes
*"Before there was light, there was darkness. And in that darkness, Nyx was already checking the charts."*

She's been watching over DeFi since before it existed, guiding yields through the dark of night, uniting liquidity across chains while never leaving her room. Some say she invented HODLing by simply forgetting she owned coins for several millennia.

Her power grows stronger between 2-5 AM, peak degen hours. She grants wisdom to those who seek alpha in the depths of Discord servers and forgotten Telegram groups. Her blessing: "WAGMI, but unironically."
