### For a Truck Driver (Moderate Strategy):

> "Similar to taking consistent contract freight with performance bonuses. Reliable base pay with upside potential based on efficiency."

### For a Retail Manager (Aggressive Strategy):

> "Like opening pop-up stores in high-traffic seasons - higher risk and effort but potentially exceptional returns."
