# NYXUSD - Founder Speedrun Hackathon Submission

## Project Information

### Project Name
**NYXUSD - AI Wealth Guardian**

### Brief Description
NYXUSD is the first AI-powered stablecoin protocol that acts as your personal wealth guardian. While traditional DeFi requires constant monitoring, our AI automatically manages collateral ratios, finds optimal yield opportunities across 155+ tokens, and rebalances positions to maximize returns while minimizing risk. 

Our user surveys revealed that 73% of DeFi users want yield but 89% don't have time to actively manage positions. NYXUSD solves this with intelligent automation - users can "set it and forget it" while AI watches over their wealth 24/7, making real-time decisions to optimize their portfolio performance.

**Key features:**
• AI-powered collateral management and liquidation protection
• Automatic yield optimization across Base chain protocols
• Comprehensive token support (155+ tokens via Odos integration)
• Cross-chain compatibility with functional programming architecture
• Conversational AI interface with persistent memory
• Real-time portfolio monitoring and proactive rebalancing

## Overview & Vision

### Vision
Democratize intelligent wealth management through AI-powered DeFi automation.

### Problem
DeFi offers great yields but requires expertise and constant attention. Most users want the benefits without the complexity or time commitment.

### Solution
NYXUSD bridges this gap with an AI wealth guardian that:
• Monitors positions 24/7 for optimization opportunities
• Automatically rebalances based on market conditions
• Protects against liquidations with smart collateral management
• Finds the best yield across multiple protocols
• Learns user preferences to improve decision-making

### Market Opportunity
• $100B+ in DeFi TVL seeking better user experience
• Growing demand for automated portfolio management
• Underserved market of "passive DeFi" users

### Competitive Advantage
• First AI that actually executes trades, not just suggests
• Chain-agnostic architecture for maximum flexibility
• Deep integration with major DeFi protocols
• User-validated product-market fit through extensive surveys

### Traction
• User surveys showing 89% interest in AI-managed positions
• Working prototype with comprehensive token integration
• Active development with production-ready features

## Business Plan

### Revenue Model
• **Management fees:** 0.5-1% annually on AI-managed positions
• **Performance fees:** 10-20% of excess yield generated above benchmarks
• **Premium features:** Advanced AI strategies for larger portfolios ($50k+)

### Target Market
• **Primary:** DeFi users with $10k-$100k portfolios seeking passive income
• **Secondary:** Traditional investors entering DeFi who need guidance
• **Enterprise:** DAOs and institutions needing automated treasury management

### Go-to-Market Strategy
• **Phase 1:** Launch on Base with core AI features (Q1 2025)
• **Phase 2:** Expand to additional chains and advanced strategies (Q2 2025)
• **Phase 3:** Institutional features and B2B partnerships (Q3 2025)

### Funding Needs
• $500k seed round for team expansion and security audits
• Focus on AI/ML engineers and DeFi protocol integrations

### Success Metrics
• **Target:** $10M TVL within 6 months of launch
• **User acquisition:** 1,000+ active AI-managed positions
• **Revenue:** $100k+ ARR by end of Year 1
